# Dark Degeneracy

Data and coding made by Vitor Petri, Valerio Marra and Rodrigo von Marttens.

This project are the results of my masters research in Cosmology. Here you can find the data gathered using `cobaya`, the .yaml files used to sample the parameters are included. 

With the sampled data and a modified version of `class` (made by us) we checked the evolution with respect to time of some parameters
